The AI Driven Web Platform for Smarter Health Insurance Fraud Detection is a 
comprehensive solution developed to address the growing issue of fraudulent health 
insurance claims using artificial intelligence and machine learning. This web based 
platform features a secure user authentication system, allowing users to register and log in 
with their credentials safely stored in an SQLite3 database. Upon authentication, users can 
access the Fraud Detection Module, where they input claim data such as patient ID, name, 
age, treatment type, hospital details, claim amount, and medical history. The core of this 
module is the Naive Bayes algorithm, a probabilistic classifier that processes the input 
data, compares it with historically labeled claims, and predicts the probability of the claim 
being fraudulent or legitimate. The system also calculates a fraud risk score to assess the 
level of suspicion associated with a claim. To further enhance the model's accuracy, the 
platform enables users to upload historical patient data files, which help retrain the model, 
refine predictions, and identify new patterns in fraudulent activity. All data, including user 
accounts, claim entries, predictions, risk scores, and uploaded files, are securely stored in 
an SQL database, ensuring traceability and transparency. By integrating machine learning 
intelligence with secure data handling and a user friendly interface, the system reduces 
false positives, minimizes financial losses for insurers, and enables data driven decision 
making, empowering insurance providers to detect fraudulent claims more accurately and 
streamline claim processing, ultimately fostering trust in digital healthcare systems.
